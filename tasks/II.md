# Research

* Analyse in detail the specification chosen in the first task.
* Indicate related modules and discuss intercommunication, common interface, functionality overlapping or any other necessary questions with other teams.
* Define the testing strategy. Teams must use all available official testing methods (such as [General Test Format](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/test_formats/README.md)) in combination with the unit and other types of testing, testing against alternative implementations, etc. to achieve desired test coverage and correctness of further tasks.
* Specify the parts of functionality (no less than 50%) that is going to be implemented in task III.
* Each member prepares a thorough presentation for the part the member is responsible. The team delivers a seminar (based on presentations) discussing implementation details of the component that the team is going to implement.
* During the presentation, team members demonstrate a deep understanding of the module. The presentation must include technical details, interfaces with the other modules. The team must repeat the presentation until they demonstrate such understanding and there are no unclear parts.

# Implementation I
  
Implement the first half of the chosen module using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language and the following requirements:

* Split your chosen module into two roughly equal meaningful parts.
* Deliver the module (first half) as a Rust crate following the specification. The crate should be interchangeable with alternative implementations (delivered by other students or contributors) within the platform.
* Define a public interface of the crate. Other teams may depend on your crate so publish your interface as early as possible. The fastest wins, but the original author still has a right to change the interface if a better option is offered by some other team.
* Write automated tests. Desired automated test coverage is 100%. The coverage may be lower if there is a valid reason, however, the coverage must be at least 80%. Tests must pass.
* Pass the linters and any other checks in `scripts/ci`.
* Make a fork and a pull request if you need any changes to the provided type system. Your pull request will be merged once +1 every team approves it.
* Make a fork and a pull request for your crate and improve the code according to the feedback.
